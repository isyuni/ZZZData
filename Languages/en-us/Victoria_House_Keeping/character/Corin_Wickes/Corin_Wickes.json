I found her skittish attitude unsettling at first, but the girl did a great job! Every task I gave her she did well. I just don't understand why she always looks so scared, when it's me who should be scared, right? I mean she's carrying around a chainsaw-looking thing!\nSpeaking of which... That's just a fancy-looking brush, right? Please tell me it isn't actually a chainsaw.",
        "intro": "Domestic work or not, leave everything to her!\n(Oh, uhh? B-but I'm not that good!)\n\nShe's obedient, diligent and responsible, and not afraid of a little hard work!\n(One moment please! That's really not me!)\n\nShe'll never let her companions suffer, and always takes responsibility!\n(Please listen to me! Such exaggeration will make customers misunderstand!)\n\nYou'll find no better maid than Corin!\n(Oooh, please, please don't send this report out! This isn't the real me!)",
