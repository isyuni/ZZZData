        "about": "A young girl whose age and past are a mystery. It's not known where she learned such an efficient fighting style. Accidentally taken in by Nicole and joined the Cunning Hares, she gradually became a strong, and most trusted companion. She likes movies, but due to a lack of common sense, she often believes them real and follows their example...",
        "intro": "A mysterious young girl who never talks about her past, almost as if she didn't have one. She is calm and collected, and unusually competent and efficient in combat, almost as if she'd had years of training. In an unexpected incident, Nicole brought her back to the Cunning Hares, and she's has an emotional independence on her ever since. She loves watching movies, but due to certain lack of common sense she seems to almost think them real-life stories.",
